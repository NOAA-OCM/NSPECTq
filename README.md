# NSPECTq
QGIS 3.x version of NSPECT, a tool for estimating nonpoint source pollution and erosion.  

This repo represents a work in progress for the adaptation of the VB.net version of OpenNSPECT, which runs on the MapWindow v4.8 GIS platform, into a python-based version running on QGIS 3.x.  At the present, 8/2/2017, there is not particular timeline for completion of the project.  It is being done as time allows.  Collaborators are welcome and encouraged to contact Dave Eslinger at dave.eslinger@noaa.gov to discuss becoming involved.
